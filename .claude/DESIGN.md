```

Next.js owns rendering and UX; Go owns data, auth, external integrations, and
analytics. They speak JSON over `/api`, proxied by a Next.js rewrite so the
session cookie stays same-site and there is no CORS layer.

## Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Next.js frontend | All rendering and UX. Proxies `/api/*` to the backend via a rewrite. |
| Go API (`httpapi`) | Routes, request auth, JSON. `server.go` is the route source of truth. |
| `store` | All SQL, hand-written, over pgx. Owns `schema.sql`. |
| `ingest` | Cube pool sync: parse pasted list, resolve, diff `cube_cards`. |
| `decklist` | Decklist parsing and per-card resolution against the pool. |
| `scryfall` | Batched card client (75 identifiers per request), rate-limited. |
| `images` | Downloads and serves card images from a local cache. |
| `analytics` | Pure `aggregate()` over deck rows plus a persistence/promotion engine. |
| `jobs` | Postgres-backed queue, a polling worker, and a periodic scheduler. |
| `revalidate` | Calls the frontend's revalidation webhook after a recompute. |

```

## The request Caller

Every backend operation receives a `context.Context` carrying a `Caller`, built by
auth middleware from the session cookie, or absent for public calls.

```go
type CallerKind int
const ( Public CallerKind = iota; Authenticated )

type Role int
const ( RoleUser Role = iota; RoleAdmin )

type Caller struct {
    Kind   CallerKind
    UserID uuid.UUID   // zero when Public
    Role   Role
}
```

Authorization lives in small predicates the handlers consult, e.g.
`caller.CanMutateOwned(deck.UserID)` = `Role == Admin || deck.UserID == caller.UserID`.
Read endpoints accept `Public`; create/update/delete require `Authenticated` plus
an ownership or role check. One auditable place per rule.

## Data model

Color identity is a 5-bit bitset (`SMALLINT`, 0–31): `W=1, U=2, B=4, R=8, G=16`;
colorless = 0.

| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | accounts | `id, username, email, display_name, bio, avatar_url, role, password_hash (nullable)` |
| `oauth_accounts` | Google links (table only — OAuth is unimplemented) | `user_id, provider, provider_account_id` |
| `sessions` | server-side sessions, revocable | `id (token), user_id, expires_at` |
| `cubes` | a card pool = one pasted list | `id, name, card_list (raw paste, source of truth), content_hash, moxfield_public_id (display only), last_synced_at` |
| `cards` | Scryfall cache | `scryfall_id (pk), oracle_id, name, slug (generated), cmc, type_line, colors, color_identity, rarity, image_*, raw jsonb` |
| `cube_cards` | pool membership + history | `cube_id, card_id, quantity, added_at, removed_at (nullable), is_active` |
| `cube_sync_progress` | live progress for the admin sync UI | `cube_id (pk), status, cards_total, images_total/done/failed, unresolved text[]` |
| `decklists` | deck + metadata + record | see below |
| `decklist_cards` | normalized deck contents | `decklist_id, card_id, card_name, quantity, is_resolved, board` |

`cards.slug` is a **generated** `STORED` column powering `/cards/<slug>`, so it
cannot drift from the name. It is not unique — two printings of a name are two
rows — so slug lookups tie-break rather than assume one hit.

`cube_sync_progress.unresolved` holds names Scryfall could not resolve on the last
sync. They are dropped from the pool, so surfacing them is what keeps a typo from
silently shrinking the cube.

### `decklists`

Metadata, the list, and the record all live in one table; the record is nullable
and added after the fact.

```
id, cube_id, user_id            -- uploader; owner + admins get update/delete
name, description
color_identity    smallint      -- inferred bitset (splashes excluded)
splash_colors     smallint      -- inferred bitset of sub-threshold colors
archetype         text null     -- CHECK enum: aggro|control|midrange|tempo|combo
source_url        text null
decklist_raw      text          -- the raw pasted list
card_count        int
status            text          -- draft | active | archived
played_at         date          -- the day it was played; defaults to today
-- record (nullable, added later; updating these triggers a recompute)
games_played, wins, losses      -- int, default 0
event_name        text null
record_updated_at timestamptz null
winrate           numeric GENERATED ALWAYS AS
                    (CASE WHEN games_played>0 THEN wins::numeric/games_played END) STORED
created_at, updated_at
```

`decklist_cards` is the backbone of card-level analytics — one row per card, with
`card_id` resolved against the cube pool (`is_resolved = false` when a name cannot
be matched, so import problems are visible without losing data).

## Analytics schema

Every stat table is keyed by `run_id`. `analytics_runs(id, cube_id, trigger,
status, decks_included, games_included, is_current, started_at, finished_at)`
tracks executions; `is_current` marks the latest good run per cube, and pages read
`WHERE is_current`. A unique partial index enforces at most one current run per
cube.

### `color_stats` — four facets in one table

```
color_stats(run_id, facet, facet_key, deck_count, games, wins, losses, winrate)
```

- `exact_identity` → `facet_key` = the 0–31 bitset (WUBRG combos).
- `single_color` → `facet_key` = one color bit (decks *containing* W…).
- `color_count` → `facet_key` = 0–5 (mono / two-color / …).
- `splash_color` → `facet_key` = one color bit (decks *splashing* W…).

Answers "do blue decks win more?", "is two-color better than five-color?", and
per-combo winrates. `splash_color` is the **only** place splashes are counted;
they are excluded from the other three, so a GW deck with two red cards does not
read as a three-color deck.

### `color_trend_stats` — the color pie over time

```
color_trend_stats(run_id, as_of, color, deck_count, total_decks, share)
```

The one time series, and the only consumer of `decklists.played_at`. One row per
(day a deck was played, color), with all five colors present on every day —
including those at zero, so an area band has a point at every x.

Cumulative: a row counts every deck dated on or before `as_of`, making the series
a meta trend rather than a per-night sample of whoever happened to build that
evening. `share` is normalized across the five colors, **not** against
`total_decks` — a two-color deck plays two colors, so the counts sum past the deck
total and would never stack to 100%. `total_decks` rides along so a reader can be
told "6 of 11 decks" rather than only a percentage. Splashes are excluded.

Days nobody played are absent rather than repeated: nothing changed, and the
straight line the chart draws between two points says that better than a row per
empty day would.

### `card_stats`

```
card_stats(run_id, card_id, deck_count, inclusion_rate, games, wins, losses, winrate)
```

Popularity is `inclusion_rate` (`deck_count / total_decks`), which is the table's
sort order. Performance is `winrate`, read alongside `deck_count` and `games`.

Note what `winrate` is *not*: a card's games are its **deck's** games, attributed
wholesale — every card in a deck inherits that deck's full record. This is the
attribution behind the removed statistics.

### `card_pair_stats`

```
card_pair_stats(run_id, card_a_id, card_b_id, co_count, pair_winrate)
```

Powers "most often played with" on a card page. Stored only for pairs with
`co_count >= 2` to bound the n² blow-up, both directions per pair, ranked by
`co_count` descending. Because the ranking is raw co-occurrence, the list skews
toward cube staples — it answers "what usually shares a deck with this card", not
"what is *specifically* associated with it".

### `meta_snapshot` and `deck_metric_stats`

```
meta_snapshot(run_id, total_decks, total_games, overall_winrate,
              avg_cmc, avg_color_count, mono_share, multi_share,
              power9_share, undefeated_decks, …)

deck_metric_stats(run_id, metric, bucket, deck_count, winrate)
```

Headline meta numbers, plus winrate by bucket (e.g. `metric='avg_cmc'`) so the
dashboard can chart "does a lower curve win?".

`power9_share` is the fraction of decks running at least one of the Power Nine,
matched by card name against a hard-coded list in `analytics.powerNine` — the
nine cards are the definition, so there is nothing on a card to derive it from.
`undefeated_decks` counts decks with at least one game played and no losses; a
deck with no record has not gone undefeated, it has not played.

Basic lands are excluded from `card_stats` and `card_pair_stats` — every deck
plays them, so they would top inclusion and co-occur with everything — and all
lands are excluded from mana-value averages.

## Jobs pipeline

```
write (deck create/update, record update, cube sync)
      │ enqueue job (coalesced by dedup_key)
      ▼
jobs worker ──▶ analytics recompute ──▶ new run promoted to is_current
      │
      └──▶ POST /api/revalidate {secret, paths[]} ──▶ revalidatePath
```

- `jobs(id, type, payload jsonb, status, scheduled_at, attempts, last_error,
  dedup_key)`. A worker goroutine polls every 2s and coalesces on `dedup_key`, so
  a burst of edits produces one recompute.
- Two job types are registered in `cmd/server/main.go`: `sync_cube` and
  `recompute_analytics`.
- `internal/jobs/scheduler.go` re-enqueues `sync_cube` for every cube with a
  `card_list`, every `SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default 360), starting 30s after
  boot. Because the syncer content-hashes the list, a periodic sync on an
  unchanged cube is nearly free — its real job is to self-heal cubes whose last
  resolve failed.
- The image-download phase runs detached from the job and reports into
  `cube_sync_progress`, so that row — not the job's status — is what "finished"
  means to the admin UI.

## API surface

`backend/internal/httpapi/server.go` is the source of truth. Public:

```
GET  /api/health
GET  /api/users                     GET /api/users/{username}
GET  /api/cubes                     GET /api/cubes/{id}   GET /api/cubes/{id}/cards
GET  /api/cards/{slug}              GET /api/cards/{id}/image   (self-hosted cache)
GET  /api/decklists                 GET /api/decklists/{id}
GET  /api/analytics/overview|colors|color-trend|cards|pairs
GET  /api/today                     (the server's date, in APP_TIMEZONE)
```

Auth — login only; there is no register route and no public signup:

```
POST /api/auth/login    POST /api/auth/logout    GET /api/auth/me
```

Authenticated, with an ownership/role check inside the handler:

```
PATCH  /api/users/{id}              POST /api/users/{id}/password
POST   /api/decklists               PATCH /api/decklists/{id}
PATCH  /api/decklists/{id}/record   DELETE /api/decklists/{id}
POST   /api/decklists/infer-colors
```

Admin only:

```
DELETE /api/users/{id}              POST /api/admin/users
POST   /api/admin/cubes             PATCH /api/admin/cubes/{id}   DELETE /api/admin/cubes/{id}
POST   /api/admin/cubes/{id}/sync   GET  /api/admin/cubes/{id}/sync-status
POST   /api/admin/analytics/recompute
```

Google OAuth is **not implemented**: the `GOOGLE_*` config and the
`oauth_accounts` table exist, but no route does.

## Frontend pages

Decks live under `/decks`; the old `/decklists` paths permanently redirect.

- `/` — redirects to the first cube's analytics. *(dynamic)*
- `/analytics` + `/analytics/[cube]` — the dense view: color charts, the color
  trend, a card table ranked by popularity, headline numbers from
  `meta_snapshot`. Scoped to a cube. *(index dynamic; `[cube]` ISR 3600)*
- `/decks` + `/decks/[id]` + `/decks/[id]/edit` — the detail page renders the
  overlaid card fan, each card linking to its Scryfall printing, plus record and
  card stats. *(index dynamic; detail ISR 3600)*
- `/decks/new` — paste a list, live color inference, record entry.
- `/cubes` + `/cubes/[id]` — the pool, same card-fan engine. *(index dynamic;
  detail ISR 300)*
- `/cards/[slug]` — printings, inclusion rate, most-played-with. *(ISR 300)*
- `/users/[username]` — bio, that player's own stats (headline tiles, colors
  played and splashed as radars, a color-pairing heatmap, their combinations
  ranked), then a dense deck list. The stats are computed in the page from the
  player's decklists, not from `meta_snapshot`: those are per-cube aggregates
  over everybody, and a player plays across cubes. *(ISR 3600)*
- `/login`, `/settings` (change password), `/admin/cubes` (paste and sync a cube,
  with live progress and unresolved names), `/admin/users` (create users, reset
  passwords).

## Key decisions

### Analytics are precomputed, not queried live

Any write that affects aggregates enqueues a `recompute_analytics` job keyed
`recompute:<cubeID>`, which dedupes concurrent triggers. The worker recomputes
every snapshot for the cube, writes a new `analytics_runs` row, and promotes it to
`is_current`; pages read the current run.

Trade-off: the whole cube is recomputed for a single deck edit. At this scale that
is cheap, and it makes every snapshot mutually consistent — no partially-updated
run is ever visible.

### Rendering is chosen per page

Index pages (`/`, `/decks`, `/cubes`, `/analytics`) are `force-dynamic`. Detail
pages are ISR: `revalidate = 3600` for decks, users, and cube analytics; `300` for
cards and cube pools. After a recompute the backend calls the frontend's
`/api/revalidate` with a shared secret.

Rejected: making index pages static. They were prerendered during `next build`,
where the backend does not exist, so they shipped empty and served that for a full
revalidate window (fixed in `f9361fe`).

Consequence: with `REVALIDATE_URL` unset — the default in dev — the webhook is a
silent no-op and pages fall back to their ISR window. A page that looks stale in
dev is usually this, not a slow job.

### Schema as boot-time idempotent SQL

`schema.sql` is embedded in the binary and re-applied by `store.EnsureSchema` on
every startup. There is no migration tool, directory, or version table.

Rejected alternatives, both actually tried: a separate migration container
(`efcd26a` replaced it with a committed dump) and a `db/schema.sql` applied by
Postgres on first init (`dcdda9a` moved to the current model). The current model
means a fresh database and an existing one converge without an ordering problem.

The cost is that every statement must be idempotent, and a failing one stops the
server from booting. Rules:

- New tables/indexes: `CREATE TABLE/INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`.
- New columns: `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, in the *Idempotent
  migrations for existing databases* section at the bottom — and also in the
  `CREATE TABLE` block, which covers fresh databases only.
- New CHECK constraints: normalize existing rows, then `DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS`
  before `ADD CONSTRAINT` (Postgres has no `ADD CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS`). The
  archetype enum is the worked example.
- Tightening to `NOT NULL`: backfill first, then `ALTER COLUMN … SET NOT NULL`.
  `played_at` is the worked example.
- A backfill re-runs forever. It is safe only when a later statement makes it
  unmatchable. Prefer a rule that re-derives itself — see below.

### Recompute rather than backfill

Deck colors are inferred at save time, so stored values can drift from the current
rule. `store.RecomputeDeckColors` re-derives every deck in a cube from the cached
`cards` rows (no Scryfall calls), and the analytics job runs it before
aggregating. A rule change therefore converges on the next run.

Consequence: changing a color rule needs no data migration, but it does need both
copies of the rule changed — the Go one at ingest and the SQL one for recompute.

### Colors come from casting cost, not color identity

A deck's colors are the colors in the casting costs of its nonland cards (Scryfall
`colors`), never `color_identity`. Color identity counts mana a card *produces*,
which made a Selesnya deck running a Mox Sapphire come out blue (`3fe29c9`).

Scryfall omits top-level `colors` on multi-faced cards and reports them per face,
so cast colors union only faces that **have a mana cost**: both halves of a split
card, an adventure, and a modal DFC count; a transform card's back does not,
because it is turned up rather than cast.

A color on under 10% of a deck's nonlands (`domain.SplashThreshold`) is a splash:
stored in `decklists.splash_colors`, excluded from `color_identity` and from every
color analytic except the `splash_color` facet.

### Cube pools are pasted lists, fingerprinted

Moxfield's API blocks the app (`c229182`), so `cubes.card_list` is the source of
truth. `content_hash` fingerprints the entry set — name, printing, and quantity —
so an unchanged list skips resolution entirely. `resolverVersion` is folded into
the hash and bumped whenever resolution changes what a given list produces,
invalidating every stored fingerprint on deploy.

Unresolvable names are recorded in `cube_sync_progress.unresolved` and shown on
the admin page rather than silently shrinking the pool (`7a21be0`, `10a2f83`).

### Self-hosted card images

Images are downloaded on miss and served from `/api/cards/{id}/image`
(`894883d`). Production uses a named Docker volume rather than a bind mount so
Docker seeds it from the image with the backend's UID already set — a bind mount
lands root-owned and unwritable (`226efd3`, and the earlier fixes `2f1770f`,
`be44537`).

### Dates are the server's, in the playgroup's timezone

`decklists.played_at` is a deck field, not part of the win/loss record; the record
PATCH deliberately does not touch it, so entering a record later cannot re-date a
deck. "Today" means today in `config.Timezone` (`APP_TIMEZONE`, default
`America/Los_Angeles`), because the container runs in UTC where the day rolls over
mid-afternoon locally. `GET /api/today` exposes it so a date picker opens on the
same day the backend would choose. `time/tzdata` is compiled into the binary
because the deploy image has no `/usr/share/zoneinfo`.

Dates cross the wire as `"2006-01-02"` inbound and midnight-UTC RFC3339 outbound.
The frontend reads the calendar day off the string (`isoDay`/`fmtDate`) because
`new Date("…T00:00:00Z")` renders the previous day west of Greenwich.

### No chart library

Charts are hand-rolled SVG (`ColorWinrateChart`, `RadarChart`, `ColorTrendChart`)
or CSS grid (`ColorPairHeatmap`). The MTG palette is semantic and cannot be
re-picked for contrast — white is a near-white and black a near-black — so every
fill carries a `--pip-ring` outline, and charts add a legend, direct labels, and a
tooltip naming every series so identity never rests on hue alone.

The one place the mana colors are *not* used is `ColorPairHeatmap`: its cells
encode a count, so they take a single-hue `--accent` ramp and let the axes carry
the colors being crossed. The ramp stops well short of solid so the number printed
in each cell keeps its contrast on both surfaces.

`ColorTrendChart` stacks its bands by where each color stands on the most recent
point, largest on top, rather than in fixed WUBRG order — the last point is the
one a reader came for. Legend and tooltip follow the same order.

## Dependencies

Backend: `go-chi/chi/v5`, `google/uuid`, `jackc/pgx/v5`, `golang.org/x/crypto`,
`golang.org/x/sync`. Nothing else direct.

Frontend: `next`, `react`, `react-dom` at runtime; `typescript` and `@types/*` in
dev. No UI, styling, charting, or data-fetching library.

External: Scryfall only.
